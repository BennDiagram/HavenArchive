## About The Sound of Oakland


The Sound of Oakland is an archive dedicated to the Oakland music scene. Oakland’s music history is long, colorful, and poorly documented; The Sound of Oakland is designed to be a living archive of Oakland’s musical past. Anyone with media connected to Oakland music – photos, videos, websites, posters, merch, and more – is invited to contribute to the archive.

Built with CollectionBuilder, the archive is controlled by a spreadsheet that can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bi-wQMxVhWHJyoOyFWztZJYMI55ObIvq2C5wKbN4BGI/edit?gid=1096870409#gid=1096870409), and a Github repository that can be found [here](https://github.com/BennDiagram/HavenArchive). Instructions on how to contribute to the repository can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDIIzA5FEKo32JubeiV3qCbZ542Yf9KQwP-RlQuhj2k/edit?usp=sharing).
